# Lists Exercise

Given an array of string names, count the number of occurrences for each name in the list, then sort the list by highest
number of occurrences.

- Run the unit test packaged with the project to understand the expected return format.
- If two or more names are the same, but have different casing, they should be treated as the same name. The casing of
  the first found instance in the characterNames array should be used in the end result.
- If two or more names have the same number of occurrences, it needs to be sorted alphabetically and numerically.
  Numbers take priority over alphabetical characters.
- Do not change `names.json`.
- Do not change the unit test.
