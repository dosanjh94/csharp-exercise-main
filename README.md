# Coding Exercise

There are two coding exercises in this solution. They've been written in visual studio, but should also work in vscode if that's your preferred IDE. Both exercises share their project file with tests. It's unrealistic, but should help you to understand what we're asking for. 

If you have any issues building the project or running the tests please reach out to your contact at Capital Pilot.
